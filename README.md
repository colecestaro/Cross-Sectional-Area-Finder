# Cross-Sectional Area Finder
The University of Virginia's Grass Assemblies for Architecture and Construction Research Team is developing a computational model to determine grass-based composite capabilities in architecture. Our team is using this code to collect cross-sectional areas from different grass species to evaluate multiple species' volumes for use in the finite volume method.
